= Where can I find all the documentation? =

You can find the complete documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/factor1/better-rest-endpoints).

= Why make this plugin? =

The core Rest API is full of information we don't really need in our responses.
This was a solution to serve up exactly what we need for making beautiful sites
with great speeds.

apps endpoints to use Better Rest Endpoints.
