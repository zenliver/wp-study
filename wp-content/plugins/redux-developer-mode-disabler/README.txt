For users who have a product with Redux Framework that a developer shipped with developer mode on (IE, annoying update notices and links to GitHub).

== Description ==

Redux is a really powerful framework. To make it easier for devs, we built in a commit notice to our repo. Unfortunately, some devs are shipping with those notices enabled. So that's why this plugin exists. It will turn off Developer Mode completely for all instances of Redux.

Sorry your developer made a mistake. But hey, we're all human aren't we? This is a pretty quick fix.

Oh, and while you're at it, you should install the [Redux Framework](http://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/) plugin if you haven't already to keep everything up to date.

= Docs & Support =
Contact your theme/plugin developer and tell them to ship an update with `dev_mode` set to false. This was their mistake, not yours.  :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

Make it so users don't have to suffer the agony of a developer who made a mistake.

= Does it have a big footprint? =

Oh yes, all 6 lines of code. It's VERY big...

= Why did you make this plugin? =

Why don't developers read instructions? Haha.

= How long did it take to make this? =

2 mins of code, 10-15 of documentation, commentary, and WordPress.org submission. Hah.

== Screenshots ==

1. If you see this, then you're in developer mode. Install this plugin to rid yourself of those annoying messages. Oh, and install the Redux Framework plugin too.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =
Version increase & forced check.

= 1.0 =
Release!


== Attribution ==

Dovy made this plugin because he got tired of answering these support questions. Developers, please ship with `dev_mode` set to false!
